        <h2>Amine and Hamza</h2>

        <p>
          Amine and Hamza M'raihi are two Tunisian musician brothers, playing
          respectively the oud and the qanun, the two major instruments of the
          classical Arabic music.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since a very young age, the brothers were raised with classical Arab
          music which allowed them to develop an extensive mastery of their
          instruments. They have since then evolved into diverse musical
          traditions including classical western music, jazz, flamenco, Indian,
          Persian music and many others. Amine and Hamza are leaders of a new
          voice into the Arabic music scenery; anchored in the classical Arabic
          tradition but opened on the diverse musical styles. They are the image
          of a new generation, proud of their multiple identities but open and
          tolerant towards other cultures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amine and Hamza have performed in many prestigious scenes all over the
          world, including the Arab World Institute in Paris, the BBC, the
          Medina Theatre in Beirut and the Cairo Opera house. They have recorded
          and published seven albums featuring musicians from all over the world
          and from different musical traditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their latest project, No Borders, dives even deeper in modern
          harmonies, hypnotic grooves and profound feeling, and features french
          clarinetist Blaise Ubaldini and swiss-indian violinist Baiju Bhatt, as
          well as polish bassist Lukacz and swedish percussionist Fredrik.

              Baiju Bhatt (1988) picked up the violin at the age of six, and
              studied western classical music at the Lausanne Conservatory
              (Switzerland) until his early twenties. He discovered jazz by
              playing piano as a kid, and soon started to play swing and other
              forms of jazz with his violin. He later studied with jazz
              violinist Pierre Blanchard, and he joined in 2009 the professional
              course of the Conservatory (HEMU) in Lausanne, in the jazz
              section, which gave him the opportunity to study violin with
              Christine Sorensen and Mario Forte, as well as jazz, composition
              and arrangement with musicians such as Emil Spanyi, Jeff Baud or
              Robert Bonisolo, and violin pedagogy with Tina Strinning.
            </p>
            <p>
              Always eager to discover new musical horizons, Baiju Bhatt has
              also studied with famous jazz violinists such as Didier Lockwood
              and Johan Renard, and with Indian musicians, which led him to play
              in December 2010 for the Princess of Jaipur with his father, the
              sitarist Pandit Krishna M. Bhatt.
            </p>
            <p>
              Baiju created in 2011 the Red Moon Collective, an international
              project combining jazz, rock, and folk and traditional music from
              India and elsewhere (awarded by the HEMU as one of the "Best Swiss
              Bachelor projects"). In addition to its concerts with gypsy swing
              bands in Switzerland and Paris (Gypsy Galaxy, Brad Brose’s
              Cat-a-Strophe, 36 rue du Swing, Gypsy Bop Combo, May Bittel,
              Bernard Dossin, Marco Neri’s Viperswing etc.), Baiju Bhatt tours
              the world since 2010 (Montreux Jazz Festival, Cully Jazz Festival
              and Caprices Festival in Switzerland, Saptak Festival Ahmedabad in
              India, Torino Jazz Festival and Vicenza World Music Festival in
              Italy, Ethno.com Festival in Serbia, Fajr International Music
              Festival in Tehran, Iran, RPAH in San Francisco and Brooklyn Raga
              Massive in New York, USA, among many others) with the virtuoso
              Tunisian brothers Amine &amp; Hamza Mraihi, the celtic pop-rock
              band Anach Cuan, and his most recent project, a jazz-rock quintet
              called Red Sun (also awarded by the HEMU in 2014).
            </p>
            <p>
              He currently lives between Switzerland and Paris, where he created
              the band Gypsy Galaxy.

            <p>
              Fredrik Gille is a percussionist from Stockholm, Sweden. He
              collects instruments, playing-techniques and inspiration from
              percussion-traditions all around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              He has a great passion for worldwide percussion-traditions and has
              collected a unique set of instruments —a constantly growing
              set-up. Learning about sounds, techniques and origins of such a
              variety of drums has given him a colourful spectrum of musical
              expressions. Spending big parts of the year on tour abroad, he
              takes every opportunity to meet and learn from local musicians and
              find new drums for his collection.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fredrik has played with groups and artists from all over the
              world, among just a few: Väsen (Sweden), Bazar Blå (Sweden), Radio
              Tarifa (Spain), Andreas Vollenweider (Switzerland). Amine &amp;
              Hamza (Tunisia). Alfredo Lagos (Spain), Mich Gerber (Switzerland),
              Karima Nayt (Algeria), Fathy Salama (Egypt), Sofia Karlsson
              (Sweden), Blau (Switzerland), Jienat (Norway) as well as
              dance-companies Flamencos en Route (Switzerland) and ÖffÖff
              (Switzerland).
